== 0.2.4 / 2009-10-10

- Features:
  - migrated to gemcutter
  - Doodle::XML::Element
    - defines class level #tag method to specify output tag name
  - obj.to_a - creates a (nested) array of [key, value] pairs
  - obj.assigned?(:name) returns true if attribute :name has a user-assigned value
  - obj.default?(:name) returns true if attribute :name has default value
  - obj.clear!(:name) resets attribute :name to default value
  - improved error reporting
  - refactored into separate files
  - more specs (improved coverage)
  - fixed some errors in datatypes
  - fixed bug core-28: cannot set init values from values defined in block
    - see spec/init_values_in_block_spec.rb for example

== 0.2.3 / 2009-03-06

- Features:
  - collect can now take multiple types, e.g.
      has :shapes, :collect => [Circle, Square]
    or
      has :shapes, :collect => {:circle => Circle, :square => Square}
  - to_json and from_json - see http:://doodle.rubyforge.org/doodle-json.html for details
  - can now specify :must and :from directly in #has params hash, e.g.
      has :answer, :from => { String => proc {|c| c.to_i } },
        :must => { "be 42" => proc {|c| c == 42 } }
  - added #assigned? for attributes, e.g.
      if obj.assigned?(:name) # => true if @name exists
  - added key_values:
      class Foo < Doodle
        has :name
        has :count
      end
      Foo.new('a', 1).doodle.key_values # => [[:name, "a"], [:count, 1]]
  - and key_values_without_defaults
  - added :expand => [false|true] to Doodle::App::Filename - expands path if set to true. Default = false
  - all specs pass on jruby-1.2.0RC2 and ruby 1.8.7p72
  - plus more docs + specs

== 0.2.2 / 2009-03-02

- Features:
  - added obj.doodle.keys method
  - added more examples to website

== 0.2.1 / 2009-03-02

- Bug fixes:
  - Doodle::App not displaying help text

== 0.2.0 / 2009-02-08
- Features:
  - object.doodle.values for easy access to array of attribute values
  - object.default?(:name) returns true if :name has default and not been assigned
  - equality
    - doodles are equal if both have the same class and values
  - comparability
    - defines <=> (so doodles are sortable by default)
  - XML serialization - require 'doodle/xml'
    simple XML serialization using Doodle class names as tag
    names. Works for me. YMMV :)
    - to_xml
    - from_xml
  - reworked website using webby

- Bug fixes:
  - all specs now pass in ruby 1.8.6, 1.9.1 and JRuby 1.1.6 (1 pending)
  - renabled String collectors

== 0.1.9 / 2008-08-13
- Features:
  - to_hash
  - doodle do .. end blocks now support #has, #from, #must and
    #arg_order
  - will now initialize a setter from a block by calling kind.new if
    kind is specified and kind is a Doodle or a Proc, e.g.

    class Animal
      has :species
    end

    class Barn
      has :animals, :collect => Animal
    end

    class Farm
      has Barn
    end

    farm = Farm do
      # this is new - will call Barn.new(&block)
      barn do
        animal 'chicken'
        animal 'pig'
      end
    end

    Will not try this for an attribute with :abstract => true

  - attributes now have :doc option
  - attributes now have :abstract option - will not try to
    auto-instantiate an object from this class
  - attributes now have a :readonly attribute - will not allow setting
    outside initialization
  - Doodle::Utils
    - deep_copy(obj)
    - normalize_keys!(hash, recursive = false, method = :to_sym),
      optionally recurse into child hashes
    - symbolize_keys!(hash, recursive = false)
    - stringify_keys!(hash, recursive = false)

- Experimental:
  - Doodle::App for handlng command line application options
  - doodle/datatypes - added more datatypes

- Bug fixes:
  - fixed reversion in 0.1.8 which enabled full backtrace from within
    doodle.rb
  - fixed bug where required attributes defined after attributes with
    default values were not being validated (had 'break' instead of 'next')

== 0.1.8 / 2008-05-13
- Features:
  - now applies instance level conversions (class level #from) to
    attribute values, e.g.

      class Name < String
        include Doodle::Core
        from String do |s|
          Name.new(s)
        end
      end

      class Person < Doodle
        has Name
      end

      person = Person 'Arthur'
      person.name.class         # => Name

  - better error reporting
  - kind can now take an array of classes or modules to match against,
  - e.g.

      has :name, :kind => [String, Symbol]

    - kind with no args now returns an array of kinds (possibly empty)

- Bug fixes:
  - #has with class param was not enforcing :kind constraint
  - moved more methods into DoodleInfo. You should now access metadata
    via:
    - obj.doodle.attributes
    - obj.doodle.conversions
    - obj.doodle.validations
    - obj.doodle.parent
    - obj.doodle.class_attributes
  - collectors initializing too late when defined at class level

== 0.1.7 / 2008-05-10
- Features
  - #has now accepts class constant in name position and generates name
    and kind from that, e.g.
      has Person --> has :person, :kind => Person
      has AudioClip --> has :audio_clip, :kind => AudioClip
  - moved datatypes code into main doodle.rb
  - use doodle.parent instead of doodle_parent

- Bug fixes:
  - fixed handling of :init blocks so they can refer to user supplied
    attribute values which don't have defaults
    - note: attributes referred to in :init blocks ~must~ be supplied as
      keyword arguments - by the time evaluation gets to the
      initialization block, the :init block has already been evaluated
      so will raise an error if it cannot find the value it's looking for
  - moved more methods into DoodleInfo from Core

== 0.1.6 / 2008-05-08
- Features:
  - short cut syntax for #must - can now specify constraints like
    this:
      must "size > 0"
      must "self =~ /[A-Z]"
    which will be evaluated as if you had written this:
      must "self =~ /[A-Z]" do |v|
        v.instance_eval("self =~ /[A-Z]")
      end
  - prefixed more public but undocumented methods with 'doodle_' to avoid clashing with
    common names (e.g. parents, attributes, validations, etc.)
  - renamed Doodle::Attribute Doodle::DoodleAttribute for same reason
  - updated specs to reflect name changes
  - attribute level validation messages now denote containing class
  - major refactoring of #has method - collections now handled by
    specialized attribute collector classes

- Bug fixes:
  - can now load keyed collection from hash

== 0.1.5 / 2008-05-06
- Bug fixes:
  - fixed bug where defaults were preventing validation working when loading from
    YAML and added spec

== 0.1.4 / 2008-05-06
- Features:
  - keyed collections - see http://doodle.rubyforge.org/#keyed_collections for details
  - specialized Attribute classes in #has - see
    spec/specialized_attribute_class_spec.rb for example

- Bug fixes:
  - fixed bug when using a collect generated method with a type but no arguments

== 0.1.3 / 2008-05-01
- really avoid wierd interaction with ActiveRecord this time
- also, managed to get rid of crufty reliance on inspect and found
  a tidy way to determine singletons :)

== 0.1.2 / 2008-05-01
- avoid wierd interaction with ActiveRecord (where calling inspect on a
  class hits the database). Thanks again to Ryan Garver.

== 0.1.1 / 2008-04-28
- changed name of #parent to #doodle_parent to avoid clash with
  ActiveSupport (thanks to Ryan Garver for reporting this)

== 0.1.0 / 2008-04-26
- doodle's first beta version - the API should remain stable from now on
- created a Google group: http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-doodle
- major change: changed Doodle from module to class so you now use
    class Foo < Doodle
  instead of
    class Foo < Doodle::Base
- Doodle::Helper renamed Doodle::Core
- added #parent method - returns outer object in initialization blocks
  (see spec/doodle_context_spec for example usage)
- fixed class and singleton attribute inheritance

    initialization)
  - use SaveBlock to distinguish between Proc and block args to :init
  - :collect now creates array by default if no :init specified (thanks to
    James Adam :)

- added spec to cover applying conversions to yaml loaded data

== 0.0.7 / 2008-03-22

- return self from validate! (so you can use idiom foo = YAML::load(yaml).validate!)

- fix normalization of keys to symbols in initialize_from_hash

- fix error not allowing nils in :init clause (because can't clone nil)

- allow more than one class in from clause (e.g. from String, Symbol do ... end)

- removed :meta as alias for :singleton_class (conflicts with openuri, facets, etc.)

== 0.0.6 / 2008-03-16

- fixed Rakefile error (wasn't including examples in rdoc)

== 0.0.5 / 2008-03-16

- added collector_spec

- tidied up validation specs

- use snake_case (from facets) when generating name from class for
  collect
